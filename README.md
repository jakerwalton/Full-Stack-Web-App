### Down The Road
- Add like buttons to the index page
- Much more CSS
- Be able to have a separate page where all images with likes can be stored and displayed
- Implement user authorization
- Allow each user to have their own unique page of like photos
- Allow users to make comments with their own username
- Users can only edit and delete their own comments
